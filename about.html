                        Iriaini Tea Factory Company Limited is a KTDA-managed factory located at Kairuthi sublocation, Iriaini North location, Othaya Central Division of Nyeri County. 
                        The factory is well served by two major streams: Thuti and Gikira. The catchment area is well linked to two major towns, Nyeri (25 km away by tarmac road) 
                        and Nairobi, Kenya’s capital (138 km away). The area is characterized by volcanic soils, and the predominant agricultural practices include tea, coffee, 
                        and dairy farming.

                        The factory site covers 39 ¼ acres. It started with small-scale holder farmers averaging 0.5 acres of tea cultivation. Today, the area under tea cultivation 
                        has grown to 1,134 hectares. Green leaf production has increased from an initial 5.1 million kilograms in 1981 to 15.7 million kilograms in 2024, 
                        with the number of farmers rising from 2,115 to 7,186 in the same period.
